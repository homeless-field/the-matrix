# The Matrix
An (admittedly overambitious) project attempting to create a simulation of a realistic world. Based on a system of people, buildings, and events

This project will act as a "tech demo" for me, including Python, Unity, C#, networking, file management, large amounts of data, etc. Documentation coming eventually
