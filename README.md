# The Matrix
A project attempting to create a simulated "world", based on a system of locations with an "event schedule" and people assigned to these events. Anyone on the planet will be able to use an API to modify this world, or use a frontend that deals with the API for them. The intention with this project is for it to never be "finished" and for it be constantly improving.

This project will act as a "tech demo" for me, including Python, APIs, custom servers, large amounts of data, open-source project management, etc. I also hope to create various frontends, from a Unity app to a web dashboard to a mobile app.
